			<p class="introduction">On this Website, you'll find the work and experiences I've had throughout University. On the Works page, there will be images that link to my work from a semester of learning HTML and CSS. Most of them are early works before I had much experience, but some of them I am quite proud of (such as the SmartLens site). The Resume page contains a brief timeline of the places I've worked at since I've started University, as well as the responsibilities I had on those jobs. Take a look around and learn all about me!</p>
